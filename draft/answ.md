Four Freedoms (FSF):
Freedom 0: Run the program for any purpose.
Freedom 1: Study and modify the code.
Freedom 2: Share copies.
Freedom 3: Share modified versions.

GNU Manifesto's Ethical Justification:
Opposes proprietary software for restricting knowledge and collaboration.
Advocates for software that benefits everyone, not just corporations.

Difference: Open Source vs. Free Software:
Free Software: Focuses on user freedoms and ethics (FSF).
Open Source: Prioritizes collaboration and efficiency (OSI).
Some open-source licenses allow proprietary use, while free software (GPL) ensures long-term freedom.

PART 3:

The debate over copyright reform has taken on a new dimension in the context of the development of large-scale language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). 
Annaâ€™s Archive article makes a provocative argument: current copyright laws in the West could be holding back innovation in AI, while countries like China have found ways 
to circumvent these restrictions, giving them a strategic advantage in the development of advanced technologies.
One of the most striking points of the article is that Chinese companies have unabashedly used Anna's Archive's vast database of scientific books and articles to train 
their AI models, while many Western companies have backed away by recognizing the illegality of this data source. This alleviates a worrying asymmetry: while the West 
remains committed to strict legal frameworks, other powers are exploiting loopholes to advance technologically without similar restrictions.
From a national security perspective, this presents a dilemma. If restricted access to valuable data impedes AI progress in the West, countries like China could 
consolidate their leadership in key technologies, from cybersecurity to military automation. In this sense, copyright reform would not only be an economic or moral 
issue, but a strategic necessity.
Proposals such as reducing the copyright period and creating specific exceptions for the preservation and mass use of texts could be viable solutions. While it is 
crucial to protect creators' rights, it is also crucial to ensure that innovation and competitiveness are not affected by outdated laws. The question the West must ask 
itself is whether it can afford not to act while other nations advance unchecked.
